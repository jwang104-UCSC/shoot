# Shoot

I grabbed a copy of my school project so I can mess with it even after the class is over. 

I plan on replacing the assets as well eventually, since most of these are "borrowed" from other places.

\[Update\] I ended up recycling and improving the ideas of this project for [another project](https://github.com/jwang104-UCSC/Wyvern).

# Installation

If not already installed, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Navigate to the directory that will hold the project in your respective command-line and enter the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwang104-UCSC/shoot.git
```

Navigate into the newly created directory:

```
$ cd shoot
```

Host the build to a local server (`http://localhost:8080/`) with the following command:

```
$ http-server
```

Remember to refresh your cache after changing your code or it won't show up. 

For Google Chrome this is accomplished by `ctrl + shift + R`.
